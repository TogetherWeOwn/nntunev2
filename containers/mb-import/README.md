# mb-import — dump import + hourly replication (batch only)

Container image for the two batch jobs behind `nntunev2-mb`
(ADR 0007). Interactive traffic never runs here.

## Jobs

| Job | Trigger | Script | SLO |
|---|---|---|---|
| Initial import | manual Container run | `import.sh <dump-dir>` | resumable per dump file; reruns are idempotent |
| Replication | hourly schedule (Container / Workflow cron) | `replicate.sh` with `PACKET_SEQ` + `PACKET_URL` | **lag < 2 h**; every packet recorded in `mb_import_state` |

## Secrets

`DATABASE_URL` comes from the secret store (GitHub Actions secrets /
Cloudflare / `~/secure-drop`) — never committed, never logged. Scripts
read it from env only.

## Rollback

Import and replication are additive upserts; rollback is "stop the job,
keep serving the previous packet" (`mb_import_state.last_packet` shows
the last good one). No destructive migrations in this path.
